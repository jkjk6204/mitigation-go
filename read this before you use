Go Not Installed or Not in PATH:

Error: go: command not found.
Solution: Make sure Go is installed and that it's in your system's PATH. You can install Go using the apt package manager as shown in the previous response.
GOPATH Not Set:
Error: GOPATH not set.
Solution: Ensure you've correctly set the GOPATH environment variable in your ~/.bashrc or ~/.profile file, and then restart your shell session using source ~/.bashrc (or source ~/.profile).
Invalid Import Paths or Missing Dependencies:

Error: import not found or other import-related errors.
Solution: Check your import statements in the Go script and ensure that you've installed any required third-party packages using go get or go mod tidy.
File Not Found:

Error: no such file or directory.
Solution: Make sure you're running the go run command from the correct directory where your Go script is located. Use the cd command to navigate to the script's directory.
Permission Denied:

Error: permission denied when trying to run the script.
Solution: Ensure you have the necessary permissions to execute the Go script and any iptables commands. You might need to run the script with sudo if it involves modifying firewall rules.
Invalid Code in the Go Script:

Error: Compilation or runtime errors related to the code in your Go script.
Solution: Carefully review your Go code for syntax errors, incorrect function calls, or logic errors. Refer to the error messages for clues on what needs to be fixed.
Firewall Rules Not Modified:

Error: The script doesn't appear to block IP addresses using iptables.
Solution: Verify that iptables is installed on your system and that the blockIPAddress function in your Go script is correctly executing the iptables command. You can test the command manually to ensure it works as expected.
